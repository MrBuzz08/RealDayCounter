Are the Days you count accurate?

I got the idea while listneing to 'The Fun in Life' by 'Elton Castee' at 0:38, he says "25,185 about how many days we have alive", from there i had a thought that did they include the leap year days or the six hours every year that turn out to be one day i.e. the 29th Feburary.

What does it do:

So normally people just multiply the number of years with 365 to get the number of days but thats wrong they dont account leap years which does not make a whole lot of diffrence in small number of days, but a large number the answer would differ slightly.

For Example: You take 20,000 days and multiply with 365 you'll get 73,00,000 but you dont account for the leap hours or the exta hours.

Just building on that i made this in a couple of days. (I am a beginner, it took time).

It is not ready yet but I am open to suggestions and improvements.
