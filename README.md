Are the Days you count accurate?

I got the idea while listneing to 'The Fun in Life' by 'Elton Castee' at 0:38, he says "25,185 about how many days we have alive", from there i had a thought that did they include the leap year days or the six hours every year that turn out to be one day i.e. the 29th Feburary.

Just building on that i made this in a couple of days. (I am a begginer, it took time).

It is not ready yet but I am open to suggestons and impovements.
